  <h1>Crates.io Package Policies</h1>
</div>

<p>
  In general, these policies are guidelines. Problems are often contextual, and
  exceptional circumstances sometimes require exceptional measures. We plan to
  continue to clarify and expand these rules over time as new circumstances
  arise. If your problem is not described below, consider
  <a href='mailto:help@crates.io'>sending us an email</a>.
</p>

<h2 id='package-ownership'><a href='#package-ownership'>Package Ownership</a></h2>

<p>
  We have a first-come, first-served policy on crate names. Upon publishing a
  package, the publisher will be made owner of the package on Crates.io.
</p>

<p>
  If someone wants to take over a package, and the previous owner agrees, the
  existing maintainer can add them as an owner, and the new maintainer can remove
  them. If necessary, the team may reach out to inactive maintainers and help
  mediate the process of ownership transfer.
</p>

<p>
  Using an automated tool to claim ownership of a large number of package names
  is not permitted. We reserve the right to block traffic or revoke ownership
  of any package we determine to have been claimed by an automated tool.
</p>

<h2 id='removal'><a href='#removal'>Removal</a></h2>

<p>
  Many questions are specialized instances of a more general form: “Under what
  circumstances can a package be removed from Crates.io?”
</p>

<p>
  The short version is that packages are first-come, first-served, and we won’t
  attempt to get into policing what exactly makes a legitimate package. We will
  do what the law requires us to do, and address flagrant violations of the Rust
  Code of Conduct.
</p>

<h3 id='squatting'><a href='#squatting'>Squatting</a></h3>

<p>
  We do not have any policies to define 'squatting', and so will not hand over
  ownership of a package for that reason.
</p>

<h3 id='the-law'><a href='#the-law'>The Law</a></h3>

<p>
  For issues such as DMCA violations, trademark and copyright infringement,
  Crates.io will respect Mozilla Legal’s decisions with regards to content that
  is hosted.
</p>

<h3 id='code-of-conduct'><a href='#code-of-conduct'>Code of Conduct</a></h3>

<p>
  The Rust project has a
  <a href='https://www.rust-lang.org/conduct.html'>Code of Conduct</a>
  which governs appropriate conduct for the Rust community. In
  general, any content on Crates.io that violates the Code of Conduct may be
  removed. Here, content can refer to but is not limited to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Package Name</li>
  <li>Package Metadata</li>
  <li>Documentation</li>
  <li>Code</li>
</ul>

<p>
  There are two important, related aspects:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    We will not be pro-actively monitoring the site for these kinds of
    violations, but relying on the community to draw them to our attention.
  </li>

  <li>
    “Does this violate the Code of Conduct” is a contextual question that
    cannot be directly answered in the hypothetical sense. All of the details
    must be taken into consideration in these kinds of situations.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id='security'><a href='#security'>Security</a></h2>

<p>
  Cargo and crates.io are projects that are governed by the Rust Programming
  Language Team. Safety is one of the core principles of Rust, and to that end,
  we would like to ensure that cargo and crates.io have secure implementations.
  To learn more about disclosing security vulnerabilities, please reference the
  <a href='https://www.rust-lang.org/security.html'>Rust Security policy</a> for
  more details.
</p>

<p>
  Thank you for taking the time to responsibly disclose any issues you find.
</p>

<h2 id='crawlers'><a href='#crawlers'>Crawlers</a></h2>

<p>
  Before resorting to crawling crates.io, please read
  <LinkTo @route="data-access">Accessing the Crates.io Data</LinkTo>.
</p>

<p>
  We allow our API and website to be crawled by commercial crawlers such as
  GoogleBot. At our discretion, we may choose to allow access to experimental
  crawlers, as long as they limit their request rate to 1 request per second or
  less.
</p>

<p>
  We also require all crawlers to provide a user-agent header that allows us to
  uniquely identify your bot. This allows us to more accurately monitor any
  impact your bot may have on our service. Providing a user agent that only
  identifies your HTTP client library (such as "<code>request/0.9.1</code>") increases the
  likelihood that we will block your traffic.

  It is recommended, but not required, to include contact information in your user
  agent. This allows us to contact you if we would like a change in your bot's
  behavior without having to block your traffic.
</p>

<p>
  Bad: "<code>User-Agent: reqwest/0.9.1</code>"<br>
  Better: "<code>User-Agent: my_bot</code>"<br>
  Best: "<code>User-Agent: my_bot (my_bot.com/info)</code>" or "<code>User-Agent: my_bot (help@my_bot.com)</code>"
</p>

<p>
  We reserve the right to block traffic from any bot that we determine to be in
  violation of this policy or causing an impact on the integrity of our service.
</p>
