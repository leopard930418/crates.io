  <h1>Accessing the Crates.io Data</h1>
</div>

<p>
  There are several ways of accessing the Crates.io data. You should try the
  options in the order listed.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <b>
      The <a href='https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index'>crates.ioindex</a>.
    </b>
    This git repository is always kept up to date by crates.io, and it is used
    by Cargo to speed up local dependency resolution. It contains the majority
    of the data exposed by crates.io and is cheap to clone and to update.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>The database dumps (experimental).</b> The dumps contain all information
    exposed by the API in a single download. They are updated every six hours.
    The latest dump is available at the address
    <a href='https://static.crates.io/db-dump.tar.gz'>https://static.crates.io/db-dump.tar.gz</a>.
    Information on using the dump is contained in the tarball.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Crawl the crates.io API.</b> This should be used as a last resort, and
    doing so is subject to our {{#link-to 'policies'}}crawling policy{{/link-to}}.
    If the index and the database dumps do not satisfy your needs, we're happy to
    discuss solutions to your needs that don't require you to crawl the registry.
    You can email us at <a href="mailto:help@crates.io">help@crates.io</a>.
