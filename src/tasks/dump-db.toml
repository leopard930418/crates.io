# This file configures what to include in public database dumps. For each
# database table, we set which columns are included in the dump, and optionally
# how to filter the rows.
#
# <table_name>.columns - a TOML dictionary determining what columns to include.
#     possible values are "private" (not included) and "public" (included).
#
# <table_name>.filter - a string that is a valid SQL expression, which is used
#     in a WHERE clause to filter the rows of the table.
#
# <table_name>.dependencies - an array of table names, used to determine the
#     order of the tables in the generated import script. All tables referred
#     to by public columns in the current table should be listed, to make sure
#     they are imported before this table.
