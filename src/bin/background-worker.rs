//! Runs enqueued background jobs
//!
//! This binary will loop until interrupted. It will run all jobs in the
//! background queue, sleeping for 1 second whenever the queue is empty. If we
//! are unable to spawn workers to run jobs (either because we couldn't connect
//! to the DB, an error occurred while loading, or we just never heard back from
//! the worker thread), we will rebuild the runner and try again up to 5 times.
//! After the 5th occurrance, we will panic.
//!
//! Usage:
//!      cargo run --bin background-worker
